# MATLAB / Simulink Code – Delta-Sigma ADC

This folder contains all MATLAB and Simulink models used for the
Inter-IIT ISRO–VLSI Delta-Sigma ADC project. It is the main software
package corresponding to the MATLAB/Simulink part of the end-term
submission (modulator, ENOB study, noise modelling and digital
decimation filter).

## Folder structure (top level)

- `1. Modulator models/`  
  Discrete-time ΔΣ modulator Simulink models for different loop orders.
- `2. ENOB vs Sampling Rate trade-off scripts/`  
  ENOB–vs–sampling-rate sweep script with its text output and summary
  plot.
- `3. Noise modeling (Flicker Noise)/`  
  Modulator models including 1/f (flicker) noise and related simulations.
- `4. Digital Decimation filter floating-point reference/`  
  Floating-point MATLAB reference implementation of the digital
  decimation chain.
- `desktop.ini`  
  OS-generated file (not used by MATLAB).

All `.m` and `.slx` files are named to indicate their function, modulator
order, and whether noise / filtering is included.

## 1. Modulator models

**Path:** `1. Modulator models/`

Contains separate folders for each modulator order:

- `ORDER_2/`
- `ORDER_3/`
- `ORDER_4/`

Each order-specific folder typically contains:

- One or more Simulink models (`*.slx`) of the ΔΣ modulator for that
  order (for example, a second-order model named
  `INTER_IIT_2ndorder_without_noise_DSM.slx`).
- A MATLAB script used to run the model and move signals/metrics into the
  workspace (for example `MATLAB_FILTER_to_workspace.m`).
- A `figures/` subfolder with simulation plots:
  - `PNG/` – PNG versions of key plots (PSD, bitstream, filtered output,
    performance metrics, etc.).
  - `EPS/` – EPS versions of the same plots for inclusion in the report.
  - Optional PNG snapshot(s) of the Simulink diagram.

These models are used as the **baseline noiseless modulators** for the
rest of the study.

## 2. ENOB vs Sampling Rate trade-off scripts

**Path:** `2. ENOB vs Sampling Rate trade-off scripts/`

This directory contains a compact, self-contained setup for the ENOB vs
sampling-rate / OSR study:

- `ENOB vs Sampling Rate trade-off scripts.m`  
  MATLAB driver script that runs the complete sweep, calls the required
  modulator and decimation models, and prints/saves the ENOB-related
  results.
- `OUTPUT.txt`  
  Plain-text output file generated by the script, containing the
  numerical ENOB / SNDR values for each tested sampling rate.
- `enob_sampling_tradeoff_plot.png`  
  Summary figure showing the ENOB vs sampling-rate trade-off (and
  related curves) for inclusion in the report or slides.


For detailed usage instructions, refer to the comments inside
`ENOB vs Sampling Rate trade-off scripts.m` and to the local README (if present).

## 3. Noise modeling (Flicker Noise)

**Path:** `3. Noise modeling (Flicker Noise)/`

This folder extends the base modulator models to include noise sources,
with separate subfolders for each order:

- `ORDER_2/`
- `ORDER_4/`

Each order folder typically includes:

- Simulink models of the ΔΣ modulator **with flicker noise** inserted at
  appropriate nodes (for example `INTER_IIT_2ndorder_with_noise_DSM.slx`
  or `INTER_IIT_order_4_with_noise_DSM.slx`).
- Optional “before/after” versions of the models to document design
  evolution.
- Subfolders such as:
  - `noise_at_1_input/`
  - `noise_at_3_input/`
  
  which contain simulations where the same noise profile is injected at
  different positions in the loop.

- PNG snapshots of the Simulink diagrams and representative waveforms /
  spectra (for quick visual inspection and for use in the report).

These files are used to compare **flicker noise**, **chopping options**
and general noise behaviour across orders and injection points.

## 4. Digital Decimation filter floating-point reference

**Path:** `4. Digital Decimation filter floating-point reference/`

This folder contains the **reference digital decimation chain** used to
process the modulator bitstream:

- `MATLAB_FILTER_to_workspace.m`  
  Main MATLAB script that implements the floating-point decimation
  filter chain (e.g. SINC/CIC and FIR stages), runs example test cases,
  and exports signals and metrics to the workspace.
- `README_Digital_Decimation_Filter.md`  
  Detailed description of the decimation filter architecture, usage and
  parameters.
- `README_Digital_Decimation_Filter.pdf`  
  PDF version of the same README for convenience.

These files serve as the **golden model** for validating RTL / fixed-
point implementations of the digital filter.

## Usage notes

1. Open MATLAB and set the current folder to `1. MATLAB Simulink Code/`.
2. Add subfolders to the MATLAB path (either manually or using
   `addpath(genpath(pwd))`).
3. For a quick demo:
   - Go to a specific order in `1. Modulator models/ORDER_X/`.
   - Open the main `.slx` modulator model and run the associated
     MATLAB script (e.g. `MATLAB_FILTER_to_workspace.m`).
   - Inspect the signals in the workspace and the plots saved in
     `figures/`.
4. For ENOB trade-off or noise studies, run the corresponding scripts in
   folders `2` and `3`, following the comments at the top of each
   script or the local READMEs.

## Environment

These models are intended to be run with:

- MATLAB + Simulink (version as specified in the main project
  environment file).
- Standard Signal Processing / DSP toolboxes as required.
