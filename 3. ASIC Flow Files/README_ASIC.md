# ASIC Flow Files – Digital Decimator

## 1. Overview

This directory contains the ASIC implementation artifacts for the digital decimation filter / decimator block used in the Delta–Sigma ADC project. It groups together the synthesis script, synthesis reports, gate-level netlists, and a snapshot of the final layout.

The structure matches the requirements of the ISRO–VLSI end-term submission: a clear hand-off from RTL to synthesized netlist and layout view.

## 2. Folder structure

- `1. Synthesis scripts + reports/`
  - `Synthesis Script/`
    - `synth_decimator.tcl` – top-level TCL script used to run logic synthesis for the decimator. It typically:
      - reads the RTL (Verilog) design,
      - sets up libraries and constraints (clocks, I/O, timing),
      - runs synthesis/optimization,
      - writes reports and the synthesized gate-level netlist.
  - `Reports/`
    - `area.rpt` – area utilization summary.
    - `power.rpt` – power report (dynamic + leakage, depending on tool setup).
    - `timing.rpt` – timing analysis (setup/hold, worst-case slack).
    - `qor.rpt` – “quality of results” summary from the synthesis tool.
    - `check_design.rpt` – structural/design-sanity checks produced by the tool.

- `2. Netlist files/`
  - `Netlist.v` – primary synthesized gate-level netlist for the decimator block.
  - `Netlist_2.v` – secondary or alternate gate-level netlist (e.g. from a different constraint set / iteration). Both are included so that the flow is reproducible.

- `3. Layout/`
  - `layout.png` – exported image of the final layout view of the synthesized decimator (placed and routed), used for documentation and the report.

The `desktop.ini` files are automatically generated by the OS and are not part of the design flow.

## 3. How to reuse these files

- **To re-run synthesis**  
  Open your synthesis tool and source `synth_decimator.tcl`, adjusting library paths and environment-specific variables as needed.

- **To simulate at gate level**  
  Use `Netlist.v` (or `Netlist_2.v`) as the design under test together with the same testbench used for RTL simulation. Make sure to include any standard-cell library models required by your simulator.

- **To document results**  
  - Include relevant snippets from `area.rpt`, `power.rpt`, `timing.rpt` and `qor.rpt` in the written report.
  - Use `layout.png` as the visual illustration of the final layout.

## 4. Notes

- File names have been kept descriptive so that it is clear which step of the flow each file belongs to.
- Paths, library names and tool commands inside `synth_decimator.tcl` may need small edits when the project is moved to a different machine or CAD installation.
